# ML-Project (Machine learning project)

This Jupyter notebook resume all our programmation work on binary classification (school project), the Banknote Authentication Dataset and the Kidney Disease Dataset.
A project about an automated model for two different datasets, looking for the best model among SkLearn to complete the task.

**Summary:**

Part I : Data Cleaning (function preprocessing)

Part II : Result evaluation (function accuracy)

Part III : Models used

- 1-cross-validation (function models_1cv)
- N-cross-validation (function models_Ncv)
- Model mean (function model_mean)
- Part IV : Global function (function finalFunction)
